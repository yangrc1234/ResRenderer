# ResRenderer(WIP)
Working in progress. Nothing here for now.  

It's mainly my coding practice for learning graphics API, and even some fancy ideas.  

It's designed to be cross-platform, cross-API.  

## Roadmap
- [ ] Low-level DX/OpenGL api wrapper.
    - [ ] Draw a triangle.  
        - [x] OpenGL  
        - [ ] DirectX
- [ ] PBR sample
- [ ] Async rendering thread
